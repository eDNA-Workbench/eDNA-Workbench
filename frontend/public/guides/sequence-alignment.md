# MSA Viewer
An interactive viewer for reviewing and editing character-wise multiple sequence alignments.

**Input Required:**
*   **Alignment File:** FASTA format, where all sequences must have the same length (e.g., `ZpDL_Zacco_platypus.asv.fa`).

**Functionalities:**
*   **Visualization:** Nucleotides are color-coded for easy viewing. Users can resize the sequence definition line (defline) panel.
*   **Editing:** Select specific columns (one or more) to perform edit operations on characters.
*   **Undo/Redo:** Use "Previous step" to undo the last operation and "Recover" to redo it.
*   **Search:** Locate specific read IDs within the alignment.
